# Week 4 report

## What I've done this week

- Made (early versions) of the encryption / decryption functionalities, currently fails with message signing (granted, it's a rather easy thing to fix)
- Made a file helper to deal with creating the directories and files for generated keys, making the application nicer to use
- Added more functionality through the actual UI so the algorithm can be used properly without calling individual functions randomly from multiple scripts

## Project progress

Once again I spent less time on this than I intended but nevertheless the project is progressing well. There are still bugs present, some tests are missing and unused stuff remains in the code but
technically the algorithm is sort of ready, since the user can generate keys and encrypt/decrypt messages (integers, I didn't/won't implement padding).

## What I learned

I got some rehearsal in handling files in Python which I oddly enough haven't done in a long time. I didn't really learn anything new about the RSA algorithm since I was mostly finished with the core logic stuff.

## Uncertainties and challenges

Nothing in particular.

## Plans for the next week

More tests, fix the known bugs and remove code that isn't used anymore. And the peer review, of course.

## Used hours

Around 10 hours.
