# Week 1 report

## What I've done this week

- Chose the topic for the project (RSA encryption/decryption)
- Wrote this and the specification document
- Researched the RSA algorithm and connected algorithms, studied other implementations (in real code and pseudocode)

## Project progress

The project itself didn't really progress at all, I merely chose the topic and wrote the required documentation.

## What I learned

Some basics about the RSA algorithm. Also, when choosing a topic for a course like this, carefully research before choosing.
I wanted to make a Minesweeper solver but it turned out that CSCSP solvers can take thousands of lines of code. RSA seemed much more approachable for my skill level (and available time).

## Uncertainties and challenges

Nothing yet.

## Plans for the next week

Start implementing key generation, especially Miller-Rabin for finding large primes for key generation.

## Used hours

Around 10 hours.
