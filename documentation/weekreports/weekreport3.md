# Week 3 report

## What I've done this week

- Implemented the extended Euclidean algorithm
- Wrote tests for most of the algorithms used
- Added more documentation / docstrings
- Made an early version of the testing document (`tests.py`)

## Project progress

Somewhat unhappy with my progress this week, since I focused too much on researching minor details (such as how big the 
difference should be between the two large primes and should it even be tested). Also had a lot of work with other courses.

Still, I managed to get the final auxiliary algorithm working and wrote a bunch of tests.

The UI is still a work in progress, as in it sort of exists but doesn't quite connect to application logic. Not that the UI
really serves any purpose before the whole algorithm is functioning - from key generation to encryption and decryption.

I'm planning to progress better next week.

## What I learned

I believe I now have a pretty good idea most of the mathematics behind the RSA algorithm, although a lot of it is not actually
needed to implement the algorithm.

## Uncertainties and challenges

Nothing in particular.

## Plans for the next week

Next week I'll likely get the RSA algorithm fully functional, key generation, encryption and decryption included.

## Used hours

Approximately 10 hours.
