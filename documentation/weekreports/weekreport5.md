# Week 5 report

## What I've done this week

- Made the peer review
- Added support for (or more so fixed the lack of) message signing
- Improved the UI, switched to using a builtin input parser library (shlex)

## Project progress

The project progressed fairly little this week. There is still stuff to do but the algorithm itself is pretty much ready.

## What I learned

That sometimes it's better to use premade libraries - I spent a couple hours building an excessively complicated user input parser before I realized that a builtin library already existed for the specific purpose.

Also, through the peer review, I learned that there was another way for determining the private exponent by using the Euler totient function instead of the Carmichael totient function. Or to be precise, I had heard
of it before but sort of overlooked it.

## Uncertainties and challenges

Nothing right now.

## Plans for the next week

Hopefully finish a bunch of UI stuff and error handling.

## Used hours

Around 10 hours.
