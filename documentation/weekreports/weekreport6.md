# Week 6 report

## What I've done this week

- User can now actually encrypt strings instead of integers
- Fixed possibly varying bit length of chosen primes and consequently the modulo of the key
- UI improvements
- Tests for Miller-Rabin
- More docstring
- Testing and implementation documents up-to-date

## Project progress

Unit testing is now practically complete, all classes and methods/functions have docstrings and
reasonable code documentation. UI went through some improvements and most importantly the user can now
input message strings instead of integers for the encryption algorithm.

## What I learned

I didn't really learn much new this week. Most of the work was improving the already existing stuff like testing
and user experience.

## Uncertainties and challenges

Nothing right now.

## Plans for the next week

Hopefully finish a bunch of UI stuff and error handling.

## Used hours

Around 9 hours.
